## Infrastructure

The aim of the projects herein is to simplify the repeated use of a variety of frameworks, and cloud services &platforms.  For example,
the [hive](./hive/README.md) project simplifies the process of projecting a structure onto a repository of data files
via [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/); subsequently, the repository can be written to, read from, and queried
via SQL (Structured Query Language).
