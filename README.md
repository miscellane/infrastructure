**Notes in progress**

### Infrastructure

The aim of the projects herein is to simplify the repeated use of a variety of frameworks/tools.  For example, 
the [hive](./hive/README.md) project simplifies the process of projecting a structure onto a repository of data files 
via [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/); subsequently, the repository can be written to, read from, and queried 
via SQL (Structured Query Language).

The notes of each project are within each project's section:

* [connecting](./connecting/README.md)

* [hive](./hive/README.md)

* [scalike](./scalike/README.md)
